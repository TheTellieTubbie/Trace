All we ever hear from you is blah, blah, blah
So, all we ever do is go ya, ya, ya
And we don't even care about what they say


Thank you Ms. Graham for coming today. 
You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. 
They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that 
So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. 
As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano.
 He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. 
Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. 
If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. 
I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding.

I don't give a fuck if you love me, I don't give a fuck if you like me
Askin' me, "How did it feel?" Can't say it didn't surprise me
Last time I looked to my right, you was standing beside me
How can some people I love hang around pussies who try me? Let's go
What did I miss?
What did I miss?
What did I miss?
What did I miss?
Let's go, let's go

[Verse 1]
I'm whippin' around on like six hundred acres, let's go, let's go, let's go
You just better not ask for no favors, let's go, let's go, let's go
It's love for my brothers and death to a traitor, let's go
She might decide to say no to me now, but say yеs to me later, let's go
Hеr ass is all natty like Florida Gator, let's go
You switched on the guys and supported a hater, let's go
What's the get-back for It's TBD
I look at this shit like a BTC
Could be down this week, then I'm up next week
