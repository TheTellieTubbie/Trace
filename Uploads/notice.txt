Dear Dan,

Please accept this as notice of my resignation from the position of bartender at Pesto's at the Axe and Compass.

Since my notice period is 2 weeks, I believe my last day will be 12/05/2022. Please let me know if that is incorrect.

Please let me know how much accrued holiday and pay I am owed.

Thank you for the support you've given me during my time. Please let me know if there's anything you need from me before I leave.

Yours sincerely,

Gabriel
